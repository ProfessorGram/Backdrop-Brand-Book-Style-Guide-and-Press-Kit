# Backdrop Brand Book, Style Guide & Press Kit


## Backdrop Brand Name Origin Story
We believe "Backdrop" is a great name for a Content Management System (CMS) software, because, like a backdrop in the arts, it is always there, behind the scenes.

The name "Backdrop" was first conceived of by Mike McCaffrey, who also suggested the Backdrop tagline; ***"Put your content center stage"***.  

The name "Backdrop" includes a direct allusion to the theater as well as an homage to Drupal, the software Backdrop was derived from.  Drupal began its life as the code base behind the drop.com website.  Over many years, that software evolved into what we now call Drupal.  

In 2013, the Backdrop Project set out to "backwards port" a number of useful and interesting Drupal 8 features into the earlier, simpler and much more popular Drupal 7. "Backdrop" is the conjunction of "back" from "backwards port" and "drop".

## General Usage Guidance
Backdrop deliberately avoids water analogies and any imagery involving water drop shapes, in order to avoid potential confusion with the Drupal project.

### Use of Project Name in Print
When referring to the Concept, Team, Community and Effort assembled to produce the software Product known as "Backdrop CMS", the correct terminology to use is "The Backdrop Project" or "the Backdrop Project" depending on sentence placement. In this context, the word Backdrop is always capitalized and a single word.  

## Use of Product Name in Print
When referring to the work Product that the Backdrop Project was assembled to produce, the correct terminology in print is "Backdrop CMS", "The Backdrop CMS" or "the Backdrop CMS" depending on sentence placement.  

It should also be noted that the second part Product name, "CMS", serves two purposes.  

First, it is a reference to the category of software products that this Product exists within (Content Management Systems).  Second, it acts as a qualifier to distinguish this Product from both its sponsoring Project, as well as any other software Products that the sponsoring Project may elect to produce at some time in the future (Examples:  "Backdrop LMS", "Backdrop LLM", "Backdrop WDF").

## Use of Product Name in Graphics
The artistic representation and graphicsl imagery that represents the Backdrop Project was designed by Darius Garza.  It is composed of two distinct parts:  The "Logo" and the "Wordmark".

### Logo
The Backdrop "Logo" is a single regular 1:1 black (RGB: 0,0,0) square with its lower right hand corner peeled back, leaving the reverse white (RGB: 255,255,255) side of the square revealed and appearing as a white triangle:

[EXAMPLE IMAGE]()

The logo design is intended to represent a stylized backdrop, similar to those used in the arts.  Its clean, simple geometric shape is intended to physically reflect the Mission Statement of the Backdrop Project:  

***"Create a simple and clean Content Management System (CMS) powerful enough to stand behind any website."***

The peeled back corner intimates to the observer that they are welcome to take a peek at (and even participate in!) "what is happening behind the scenes".

### Wordmark
The most notable consideration with respect to the "Wordmark", is capitalization.  Exceptionally, the word "Backdrop", when used in graphical form, features an initial "b" that is lower case:

[EXAMPLE IMAGE]()

This includes all variations if "Wordmark" use.  When it appears alone and when it is paired with the "Logo".

Please note that while it is possible to reproduce the artwork in print using the 'Source Sans Pro' font, 

the base font used to generate the "Wordmark" is , 

it is impossible to achieve the correct look of the "Wordmark" with that font in the absence of adjustments made to letter spacing (kerning) to achieve the accepted "Wordmark" format.

iconography created to represent the Project in imagery (i.e. "Logo").  





## Physical Arrangement of Graphics
Graphically speaking, there are several variations as to how the artistic representation of the Project may be presented (horizontally, vertically, wordmark only, logo only).  




## Disambiguation
Both the Product and the Project are regularly referred to in casual conversation as "Backdrop", which can sometimes lead to confusion.  When a need for disambiguation between these two things arises, the full Product name ("Backdrop CMS") and full Project name ("Backdrop Project") should be used.

### Abbreviations
Since the "drop" in "Backdrop" is lower case (and part of a single word) it should never appear in abbreviations of Backdrop CMS.  The recommended practice when abbreviating Backdrop CMS (for use as an acronym or similar) the correct reference is to us "B", and never "BD".  Ultimately, "B CMS" or simply "B" are both acceptable.  Similarly, when referring to the Backdrop Project website, the recommended way to refer to it is "b.org" (or "borg" for short).  In normal conversation, "Backdrop" is often used interchangeably, with the listener resorting to context to determine for themselves whether or not the Project or the Product is being referenced.


## Logo & Wordmark Style Guide

## The Backdrop Logo

### Horizontal Orientation
When used together horizontally, the Backdrop Product Wordmark ("backdrop") should be positioned to the left of the Logo.

### Project/Product Name, Logo & Wordmark Usage Policy
The Project Name, Product Name, Logo and Wordmark are all the sole and exclusive property of The Backdrop Project.  They may not be used by any 3rd parties for any commercial or non-commercial purpose whatsoever without first having gained permission from the Backdrop Project Steering Committee to do so.

## Mascot
Drop, the Backdrop mascot, was originally designed by Marc Bovino.  Drop is a small, friendly dragon, of the type we lovingly refer to as a "lap dragon".  Drop was given their name for three reasons. 

1. "Drop" is source word for "Backdrop"
2. "Drop" is a nifty way for us to pay homage to Drupal
3. "Drop" is (we feel) a clever way play on words ("drag-and-drop")

### Mascot Usage Policy
Just as the Drupal community has the Druplicon, the Backdrop community has Drop.  

The Backdrop Project offers "Drop" to the community on open licensing terms, meaning that "Drop" name and imagery may (and should!) be used and/or adapted to suit any purpose whatsoever. Feel free to make any alterations desired to Drop in terms of their color or posture.  Embroider Drop on a hat.  Silkscreen them on a t-shirt. Use them to represent your product, company, camp, or whatever else you like.
